# Old Scripts

These script were used before using pi-gen. These scripts remain as reference, as the image is based on these scripts. When encountering any errors whilst using pi-gen, these scripts can be used as fallback. These scripts are meant to be run on a newly installed version of the official raspberry pi OS, connected to the internet.
